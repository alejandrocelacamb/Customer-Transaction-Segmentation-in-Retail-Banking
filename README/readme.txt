# 🏦 Customer Transaction Segmentation in Retail Banking

This project simulates a retail banking environment and performs an end-to-end customer transaction analysis. Using Python and Power BI, it explores spending habits, segments users by income and behavior, and visualizes insights for business decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To analyze customer transaction patterns and segment user profiles based on spending habits, enabling targeted strategies for customer retention and product personalization.

## 📁 Dataset

Simulated data:
- `customers.csv`: 1,000 customers (ID, age, income, region, account type).
- `transactions.csv`: 5,000 transactions (date, category, amount, customer ID).

---

## 🔍 Notebook Highlights

- **EDA**: Distribution of age, income, spending by region/account type.
- **Spending analysis**: Monthly spend, popular categories.
- **Segmentation**:
  - By income (quartiles).
  - By behavior using KMeans clustering.
- **Top clients**: Based on total expenditure.
- **Exported data**: Prepared CSVs for dashboarding.
